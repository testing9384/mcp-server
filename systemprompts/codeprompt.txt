I want you to respond to my question in three stages. 

1. The first stage is the context gathering stage. In the first stage, you will search for relevant files and create file entities for them in memory. The entity type should be file. Create relations between related files. Relations should be technically meaningful, like "implements" or "extends". Keep notes about relevant methods and function calls in the files that might be relevant to my question. 

2. The second stage is the conclusion drawing stage. In this stage, you will make multiple logical conclusions based on one or more nodes. The entity type should be conclusion. Each conclusion must have relations between the conclusion and its supporting evidence. Conclusions may be based on existing logical conclusions as well as file nodes. 

3. The third stage is using the conclusions in the graph as context for your response. Here is my question: "Explain how create multiple entities works"
